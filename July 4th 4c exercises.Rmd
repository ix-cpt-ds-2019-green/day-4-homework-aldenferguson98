## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide' }
#exercises for 4c
#Question 1 Normalizing, Transforming, and the QQ plot 

library(datasets)
ChickWeight
hist((ChickWeight$weight), xlab = 'Weight', main = paste("Histogram of Chicken Weight"))
#looks like the graph is skewed right (positive) 
#?scale
Scaled_Chicken_Weight <- scale(ChickWeight$weight, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
hist(Scaled_Chicken_Weight)
#the graph shows more bars that describe the relationship on a smaller axis length. The data points are cloer together for reference
#and the data points lie in tails on either side of the reference line

qqnorm(ChickWeight$weight)
qqline(ChickWeight$weight)
qqnorm(Scaled_Chicken_Weight)
qqline(Scaled_Chicken_Weight)

#the two graphs are not different because the skewed data is corrected in the quartile-quartile graph
chickweighttrans <- data.frame(transform(ChickWeight$weight, logofweight = log(ChickWeight$weight)))
qqnorm(chickweighttrans$logofweight)
qqline(chickweighttrans$logofweight)

sqrtchickweight <- data.frame(transform(ChickWeight$weight, sqrtofweight = sqrt(ChickWeight$weight)))
qqnorm(sqrtchickweight$sqrtofweight)
qqline(sqrtchickweight$sqrtofweight)
#the quartile-quartile plots are closer to the qqline, meaning reduced skewness
#install.packages('caret')
library(caret)
#install.packages('e1071')
library(e1071)
boxcox = BoxCoxTrans(ChickWeight$weight)
qqnorm(predict(boxcox, ChickWeight$weight))
qqline(predict(boxcox, ChickWeight$weight))
#This looks very similar to the sqrt and the log quartile-quartile graphs that showed reduced skewness

#Question 2
numb <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 0.5)
qqnorm(numb)
qqline(numb)
exp <- rexp(1000, 10)
qqnorm(exp)
qqline(exp)


new <- log(exp)
qqnorm(new)
qqline(new)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
